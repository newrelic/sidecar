Sidecar ![Sidecar](views/static/Sidecar.png)
=====

Sidecar is a dynamic service discovery platform requiring no external
coordination service. It's a peer-to-peer system that uses a gossip protocol
for all communication between hosts. Sidecar health checks local services
and announces them to peer systems. It's Docker-native so your containerized
applications work out of the box.

Services communicate to each other through an HAproxy instance on each host
that is itself managed and configured by Sidecar. It is inspired by Airbnb's
SmartStack. But, we believe it has a few advantages over SmartStack:
 * Native support for Docker (works without Docker, too!)
 * No dependence on Zookeeper or other centralized services
 * Peer-to-peer, so it works on your laptop or on a large cluster
 * Static binary means it's easy to deploy, and there is no interpreter needed
 * Tiny memory usage (under 20MB) and few execution threads means its very
   light weight

**See it in Action:** We've presented Sidecar at Velocity 2015 and recorded a [YouTube
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VA43yWVUnMA) demonstrating Sidecar with
[Centurion](https://github.com/newrelic/centurion), deploying services in
Docker containers, and seeing Sidecar discover and health check them.

Overview and Theory
-------------------

Sidecar is an eventually consistent service discovery platform where hosts learn
about each others' state via a gossip protocol. Hosts exchange messages about
which services they are running and which have gone away. All messages are
timestamped and the latest timestamp always wins. Each host maintains its own
local state and continually merges changes in from others. Messaging is over
UDP except when doing anti-entropy transfers. 

There is an anti-entropy mechanism where full state exchanges take place
between peer nodes on an intermittent basis. This allows for any missed
messages to propagate, and helps keep state consistent across the cluster.

Sidecar hosts join a cluster by having a set of cluster seed hosts passed to them
on the command line at startup. Once in a cluster, the first thing a host does
is merge the state directly from another host. This is a big JSON blob that is
delivered over a TCP session directly between the hosts.

Now the host starts continuously polling its own services and reviewing the
services that it has in its own state, sleeping a couple of seconds in between.
It announces its services as UDP gossip messages every couple of seconds, and
also announces tombstone records for any services which have gone away.
Likewise, when a host leaves the cluster, any peers that were notified send
tombstone records for all of its services. These eventually converge and the
latest records should propagate everywhere. If the host rejoins the cluster, it
will announce new state every few seconds so the services will be picked back
up.

There are lifespans assigned to both tombstone and alive records so that:

1. A service that was not correctly tombstoned will go away in short order
2. We do not continually add to the tombstone state we are carrying

Because the gossip mechanism is UDP and a service going away is a higher
priority message, each tombstone is sent twice initially, followed by
once a second for 10 seconds. This delivers reliable messaging of service
death.

Timestamps are all local to the host that sent them. This is because we can
have clock drift on various machines. But if we always look at the origin timestamp
they will at least be comparable to each other by all hosts in the cluster. The
one exception to this is that if clock drift is more than a second or two, the
alive lifespan may be negatively impacted.

Running it
----------

It's a Go application so just install Godep and build it with:

```bash
$ godep go build
```

Or you can run it like this:

```bash
$ go run *.go --cluster-ip <boostrap_host>
```

You always need to supply at least one IP address or hostname with the
`--cluster-ip` argument. If are running solo, or are the first member, this can
be your own hostname. You may specify the argument multiple times to have
multiple hosts. It is recommended to use more than one when possible.

### Running in a Container

The easiest way to deploy Sidecar to your Docker fleet is to run it in a
container itself. [Instructions for doing that are provided](docker/README.md).

Configuration
-------------

Sidecar expects to find a TOML config file, by default named `sidecar.toml` in the
current path, to specify how it should operate. You can tell it to use a
specific file with the `--config-file` or `-f` option on the command line.

It comes supplied with an example config file called `sidecar.example.toml`
which you should copy and modify as needed.

Sidecar supports both Docker-based discovery and a discovery mechanism where
you publish services into a JSON file locally. These can then be advertised
as running services just like they would be from a Docker host.

### Discovery

Sidecar currently supports two methods of discovery and these can be set in
the `sidecar.toml` file in the `sidecar` section.

A configuration for both Docker and static discovery looks like this:

```toml
[sidecar]
discovery = [ "docker", "static" ]
```

Zero or more options may be supplied. Note that if nothing is in this section,
Sidecar will only participate in a cluster but will not announce anything.

#### Configuring Docker Discovery

Sidecar currently accepts a single option for Docker-based discovery, the URL
to use to connect to Docker. You really want this to be the local machine.
It uses the same URLs that are supported by the Docker command line tools.
The configuration block for Sidecar looks like this:

```toml
[docker_discovery]
docker_url = "tcp://localhost:2375"
```

Note that it only supports a *single* URL, unlike the Docker CLI tool.

Sidecar can now use the normal Docker environment variables for configuring
Docker discovery. If you remove the `docker_url` setting from the config
entirely, it will fall back to trying to use environment variables to configure
Docker. It uses the standard variables like `DOCKER_HOST`, `TLS_VERIFY`, etc.

##### Labels

A few Docker labels can be used to control the discovery behavior of Sidecar.
All containers need to be started with two labels defining how they are to be
health checked. To health check a service on port 9090 on the local system with
an `HttpGet` check, for example, you would use the following labels:

```
	HealthCheck=HttpGet
	HealthCheckArgs=http://:9090/status
```

The currently available check types are `HttpGet` and `External`. `External`
checks will run the command specified in the `HealthCheckArgs` label (in the
context of a bash shell). An exit status of 0 is considered healthy and
anything else is unhealthy. Nagios checks work very well with this mode of
health checking.

Additionally, it can sometimes be nice to exclude certain containers from
discovery. This is particularly useful if you are running Sidecar in a
container itself. This is accomplished with another Docker label like so:

```
	SidecarDiscover=false
```

####Configuring Static Discovery

Static Discovery requires a configuration block in the `sidecar.toml` that
looks like this:

```toml
[static_discovery]
config_file = "/my_path/static.json"
```

That in turn points to a static discovery file that looks like this:

```json
[
    {
        "Service": {
            "Name": "some_service",
            "Image": "bb6268ff91dc42a51f51db53846f72102ed9ff3f",
            "Ports": [
                {
                    "Type": "tcp",
                    "Port": 10234
                }
            ]
        },
        "Check": {
            "Type": "HttpGet",
            "Args": "http://:10234/"
        }
    },
	{
	...
	}
]
```

Here we've defined both the service itself and the health check to use
to validate its status. It supports a single health check per service.
You should supply something in place of the value for `Image` that is
meaningful to you. Usually this is a version or git commit string. It
will show up in the Sidecar web UI.

Monitoring It
-------------

The logging output is pretty (too?) verbose and contains lots of information
about what's going on and what the current state is. Or you can use the web
interface.

Currently the web interface runs on port 7777 on each machine that runs `sidecar`.

The `/services` endpoint is a very textual web interface for humans. The
`/services.json` endpoint is JSON-encoded. The JSON is still pretty-printed so
it's readable by humans.
